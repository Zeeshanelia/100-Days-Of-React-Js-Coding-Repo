#  Zustand React E-Commerce Cart Logic

This is a beginner-friendly e-commerce project built with React, Tailwind CSS, and Zustand for state management.
Users can view products, add them to the cart, and remove items from the cart.
The cart count updates dynamically in the navigation bar.
Products are displayed in a responsive grid layout using Tailwind utilities.
State management is handled with Zustand for simplicity and scalability.
All components are created as functional components with React hooks.
Styling is fully done with Tailwind CSS for responsive design.
The project demonstrates basic React concepts like props, state, and event handling.
It’s perfect for beginners to practice component structure, hooks, and state management.
You can easily expand it with features like total price, quantities, and checkout functionality.
