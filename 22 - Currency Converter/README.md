## Currency Converter React App

- This Currency Converter is a React.js application built using functional components and the useState hook.
It allows users to enter an amount and select source and target currencies for conversion.
Axios is used to fetch real-time exchange rates from a public currency exchange API.
The application handles loading states to improve user experience during API requests.
Basic input validation prevents invalid or negative amounts from being converted.
Error handling is implemented to display user-friendly messages when the API fails.
Tailwind CSS is used for responsive layout and clean UI styling.
The converter supports multiple currencies such as USD, PKR, INR, and AUD.
The result is displayed dynamically after successful conversion.
This project demonstrates API integration, state management, and clean UI design in React.
