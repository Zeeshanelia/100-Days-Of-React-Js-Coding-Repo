##         Crypto Tracker React App



This React app displays top cryptocurrencies in PKR using the CoinGecko API.
It shows coin name, symbol, price, 24h change, volume, and market cap in a responsive table.
Users can search for coins by name or symbol using the search bar.
The 24h price change is color-coded: green for positive, red for negative.
Fully frontend-only, no API key is required, and works directly in the browser.
Built with React, TailwindCSS, and functional components for easy customization.
