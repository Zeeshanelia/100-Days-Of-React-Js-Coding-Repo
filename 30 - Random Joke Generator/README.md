##      Random Joke Generator

This project is a Random Joke Generator built using React.js and Hooks.
It fetches jokes from a public API using the Fetch API.
The joke setup is displayed first to the user.
A button allows users to reveal the punchline on click.
State management is handled using useState and useEffect.
The UI is styled with Tailwind CSS and Animate.css for better user experience.
