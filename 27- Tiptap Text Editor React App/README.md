##     TipTap Rich Text Editor

This React app integrates TipTap, a modern rich text editor, with Tailwind CSS styling.
It supports bold, headings (H1–H6), paragraphs, code, code blocks, line breaks, and horizontal rules.
Users can save content, and undo/redo actions are fully functional.
The editor is responsive and provides a clean, scrollable toolbar.
Saved HTML content is displayed below the editor for easy review or backend submission.
This setup is ideal for creating blogs, notes, or any rich text input in React projects.
