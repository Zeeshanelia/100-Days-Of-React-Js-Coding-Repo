# Emoji Finder React App
 
Built a Emoji Finder using React for a dynamic search interface.  

 - An emoji is NOT an image
Emojis such as 😀 or 😎 are text characters, not image files.
This is why they cannot be downloaded directly as .jpg or .png.

-  download logic uses <a> tag clicks
Convert emojis into real images (PNG/JPG)
Use canvas drawing 
Create flexible React download functions
Trigger file downloads programmatically
